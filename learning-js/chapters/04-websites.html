  <p>Hello, World!</p>
  <p>Today, I woke up at 6:30 and went to meet my friend Yaman. He has a flight to Canada today at 11PM and that was basically our last meet while he is in Nepal. I don't know when will we meet again! After meeting him, I am into Drawing all this day long. While drawing, I also learned some basics of JS for not being monotonous. It was good feeling when i did multitasking.</p>
